# SSS Calculator

SSS calculator is a Javascript code that calculates the grade of a student from a score input, assigns merits to drivers based on their speed input and calculates the net salary of an individual from their basic salary and benefits.
This project is part of a code challange issued by Moringa School on 26th November 2022 with the aim of helping students streamline their thought process to solving JS, CSS and HTML problem of this class.

## Installation

SSS Calculator does not require to many external resources to function albeit the follwoing;
Live Server: In oorder to run the html webpage, the Live Server for VS or any equivalent system is recommended.
All content used in the presentation of the code in the website is provided within the repository and is fully copyright free.

### Technologies

SSS Calculator has been written in the following languages.
HTML
CSS
Java Script.

## Launch

This project does not have minimum requirements. It is yet to be hosted on any server and would therefore only run through the go-live function within the ScoreSpeedSalarygen.html file. 
After going live, the page displays requests for all variable inputs. 

## Illustration

Once the page is live, The page is divided into three sections with each serving a different function.

### Technical overview 

In the first section, the user is required to input a value that falls within the accepted parameter 0 and 100. On clicking enter, the JS code computes and outputs a grade, relative to the score. The respective categories have been commented out in the code.
In the second section, the user is required to input his/ her driving speed. The JS code then outputs a value that either revokes, accepts of issues demerit points based on the speed that has been logged in.
In the third section, the user is required to input their basic salary and benefits. This totals up to their taxeable income with is then run through an algorith in JS that computes their net salary, based on the revised figures from KRA, NSSF and NHIF.
